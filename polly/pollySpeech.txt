Hello World,
My name is Brian.
I am a British male, who speaks in English.

Let me tell you a story about some friends of mine. Like Sally,
Sally sells sea shells at the sea shore.
Afterwards, she puts on some steaks on the BBQ, and grills them to a juicy medium rare, in some butter that she got from her friend named Betty.
You know Betty don't you?
Betty, who bought butter, but that made the batter bitter with her bitter butter and then Betty had to buy better butter to make the bitter batter better again? yeah! THAT Betty...Betty Botter.
Anyways, they both cracked open a few COLD ones, and they enjoyed discussing this website.

We would love to hear from you about this website too. So go ahead, and leave a comment on your experience.
and THANK YOU for visiting!
Please like and share so that more people can enjoy this website too.
